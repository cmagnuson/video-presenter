# Video Presenter

Pulls race timing data from a MySQL database and presents on two displays - one "live" display for video production, and one "controller" display for monitoring, previewing, etc.

A project from my college days in 2009.  Looking back I would definitly do some things different :)  But it got the job done.

Build a native installer (using Java 14+) with: `./gradlew jpackage`
